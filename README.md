# git-switch
A simple Windows command line executable for switching global Git config user data. Handy for machines shared by multiple developers.

This is a very simple .NET 4.6.1 console application, built in Visual Studio 2017.

The core goal is simplicity and the first version was written in a single sitting, which is why some functionality is currently missing (such as deleting registered users).

Usage details can be found by running the application with the -h flag (or any invalid arguments, for that matter).
